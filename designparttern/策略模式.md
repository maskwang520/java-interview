#### 策略模式
1. 拒绝处理Handler的接口
```java
public interface RejectedExecutionHandler {
    void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor executor);
}
```

2. 具体的四种策略
#### 在调用的线程里面处理拒绝的任务
```java
public static class CallerRunsPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates a {@code CallerRunsPolicy}.
         */
        public CallerRunsPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Executes task r in the caller's thread, unless the executor
         * has been shut down, in which case the task is discarded.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
            if (!e.isShutdown()) {
                r.run();
            }
        }
    }
```

##### 丢弃并抛出异常
```java
public static class AbortPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates an {@code AbortPolicy}.
         */
        public AbortPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Always throws RejectedExecutionException.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         * @throws RejectedExecutionException always
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
            throw new RejectedExecutionException("Task " + r.toString() +
                                                 " rejected from " +
                                                 e.toString());
        }
    }
```

##### 直接丢弃，不做任务处理
```java
public static class DiscardPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates a {@code DiscardPolicy}.
         */
        public DiscardPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Does nothing, which has the effect of discarding task r.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
        }
    }
```

##### 丢弃最旧的任务
```java
 public static class DiscardOldestPolicy implements RejectedExecutionHandler {
        /**
         * Creates a {@code DiscardOldestPolicy} for the given executor.
         */
        public DiscardOldestPolicy() { }

        /**
         * Obtains and ignores the next task that the executor
         * would otherwise execute, if one is immediately available,
         * and then retries execution of task r, unless the executor
         * is shut down, in which case task r is instead discarded.
         *
         * @param r the runnable task requested to be executed
         * @param e the executor attempting to execute this task
         */
        public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
            if (!e.isShutdown()) {
                e.getQueue().poll();
                e.execute(r);
            }
        }
    }
```

##### 策略调用位置
```java
 public void execute(Runnable command) {
        if (command == null)
            throw new NullPointerException();
        /*
         * Proceed in 3 steps:
         *
         * 1. If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, try to
         * start a new thread with the given command as its first
         * task.  The call to addWorker atomically checks runState and
         * workerCount, and so prevents false alarms that would add
         * threads when it shouldn't, by returning false.
         *
         * 2. If a task can be successfully queued, then we still need
         * to double-check whether we should have added a thread
         * (because existing ones died since last checking) or that
         * the pool shut down since entry into this method. So we
         * recheck state and if necessary roll back the enqueuing if
         * stopped, or start a new thread if there are none.
         *
         * 3. If we cannot queue task, then we try to add a new
         * thread.  If it fails, we know we are shut down or saturated
         * and so reject the task.
         */
        int c = ctl.get();
        if (workerCountOf(c) < corePoolSize) {
            if (addWorker(command, true))
                return;
            c = ctl.get();
        }
        if (isRunning(c) && workQueue.offer(command)) {
            int recheck = ctl.get();
            if (! isRunning(recheck) && remove(command))
                reject(command);
            else if (workerCountOf(recheck) == 0)
                addWorker(null, false);
        }
        else if (!addWorker(command, false))
            reject(command);
    }
```
